# 🚀 Supabase Setup Guide for Real Product Data

## 📋 Overview
This guide will help you replace all mock data with real product data stored in Supabase. Your frontend is now configured to automatically fetch products from the database.

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Supabase project set up and running
- Supabase client configured in your frontend
- Access to Supabase SQL Editor

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **`categories`** - Product categories (Essential Medicines, Supplements, etc.)
2. **`products`** - Individual products with detailed information

### Key Fields:
- **Product Details**: name, description, price, image_url
- **Medical Info**: dosage_form, strength, prescription_required
- **Inventory**: in_stock, stock_quantity
- **Organization**: category_id, sku, manufacturer

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Complete Setup Script
1. Copy the entire content from `database/create_real_products.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute all commands

### Step 3: Verify Data Creation
After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ 6 categories created
- ✅ 24 products created (6 per category)
- ✅ Proper relationships established
- ✅ Indexes for performance
- ✅ RLS policies for security

## 📱 Frontend Changes Made

### ✅ Removed:
- `src/data/mockProducts.js` (deleted)
- All hardcoded product data from `ProductSections.jsx`
- Mock data fallbacks

### ✅ Added:
- Real-time database fetching
- Loading states and error handling
- Dynamic category grouping
- Stock status indicators
- Proper error boundaries

## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

### 1. Check Database Tables
```sql
-- Verify categories
SELECT * FROM categories;

-- Verify products
SELECT p.name, p.price, c.name as category 
FROM products p 
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id;
```

### 2. Test Frontend
1. Start your React app
2. Navigate to the home page
3. Products should load automatically from Supabase
4. Check browser console for any errors

### 3. Verify Product Display
- Products should be grouped by category
- Each category should show up to 6 products
- Product cards should display real data
- Add to cart functionality should work

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "No products available" message
- Check Supabase connection in browser console
- Verify tables exist and contain data
- Check RLS policies are properly set

#### 2. Products not loading
- Verify `ProductService.getProducts()` is working
- Check network tab for API calls
- Ensure Supabase URL and keys are correct

#### 3. Categories not grouping properly
- Verify `category_id` relationships exist
- Check that categories table has data
- Ensure JOIN queries are working

### Debug Commands:
```sql
-- Check if products have categories
SELECT p.name, c.name as category_name 
FROM products p 
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id;

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('products', 'categories');
```

## 📈 Adding More Products

### Manual Addition:
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, description, price, category_id, image_url, sku) 
SELECT 
  'New Product Name',
  'Product description here',
  99.99,
  c.id,
  'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  'SKU001'
FROM categories c WHERE c.name = 'Category Name';
```

### Bulk Import:
1. Prepare CSV file with product data
2. Use Supabase's **Table Editor** → **Import** feature
3. Map columns to table fields
4. Import and verify data

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- **Categories**: Public read access
- **Products**: Public read access to active products only
- **Admin operations**: Protected by authentication

### Data Validation:
- Price must be positive
- Required fields enforced
- Unique SKUs and names
- Proper foreign key relationships

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created:
- `category_id` for fast category lookups
- `name` for product searches
- `price` for price-based filtering
- `in_stock` and `is_active` for status filtering

### Query Optimization:
- Products fetched with category data in single query
- Pagination support (limit: 50)
- Efficient JOIN operations
